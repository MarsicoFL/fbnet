Description: Open-source package for computing likelihood ratios in kinship testing and human identification cases (Chernomoretz et al. (2021) <doi:10.1016/j.fsir.2020.100132>). It has the core function of the software GENis, developed by Fundaci√≥n Sadosky. It relies on a Bayesian Networks framework and is particularly well suited to efficiently perform large-size queries against databases of missing individuals (Darwiche (2009) <doi:10.1017/CBO9780511811357>).
